<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ibrahim Musa Sumayin. I’m passionate about graphic design and web development, and I enjoy creating designs that are both creative and meaningful. My journey started in 2023 when I helped a friend design a logo and flyer, and that experience inspired me to turn my interest into something bigger</p>

<p>I founded Zuko Designs, where I work on different design and web projects that bring ideas to life. I’ve learned through online courses and practice, earning certificates that helped me build a strong foundation in both fields</p>

<p> I’m always looking for new ways to improve my skills, learn from others, and create work that inspires people. For me, design isn’t just about visuals — it’s about telling stories and making ideas stand out</p>
